# Bioinformatics


The BRIC Bioinformatics Core Facility supports researchers at the BRIC center, the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). 

The Facility is composed of a multidisciplinary team updated on the latest technologies in molecular biology . 


**Multiple services are offered:** \
1. Support in analyzing biological data, \
2. Access to a maintained high-performance computational server and, \
3. Training in bioinformatics. 



```{r fig-core, echo = F, eval = T }
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/flb202/Documents/KU/BRIC/Core/Core.png')
```

* Data analysis is offered to other scientists at the University of Copenhagen and external institutions, although with a priority to BRIC scientists.


# Our Services

Our support involves **consultation**, **data analysis**, **guidance**, **long-term projects** and **training**.

<span style="color:red"> **A. Consultation**</span>

You are always welcome to talk with us! We can work together to understand your needs.

<span style="color:blue"> **No fee is applied to understand your needs**</span>

<span style="color:red"> **B. Experimental Desing**</span>

Including a bioinformatician in an early stage of your project can save you time, work, and money and make you apply effort and what matters.

<span style="color:red"> **C. Data Analysis**</span>

When you have your data but need help running the pipeline or us to do everything, we can talk to understand your needs.

We're always open to talk.

<span style="color:red"> **D. Standard bioinformatics project**</span>

**A plus in using our services:** We work with optimized pipelines ensuring reproducibility and providing reports.


<span style="color:blue"> **Estimating hours is always challenging; we can offer a starter package of 20 to 30hrs for the following analysis**</span>

1. Gene Expression \
1.1 RNA-seq \
1.2 

2. Ataq-seq

3. Single Cell

**Juliana Assis, PhD**

I'm a Biologist with a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. My field lies broadly in multi-omics data such as Genomic, Transcriptomic, Metagenomic, Metabolomics, and Data Integration.
I have extensive experience developing the strategy/experimental design and scientific skills for NGS analysis and long-reads. Making Reproducibility in research is my main focus of study.
