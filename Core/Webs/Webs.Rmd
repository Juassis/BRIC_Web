# Bioinformatics


The BRIC Bioinformatics Core Facility supports researchers at the BRIC center, the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). 

The Facility is composed of a multidisciplinary team updated on the latest technologies in molecular biology . 


**Multiple services are offered:** \
1. Support in analyzing biological data, \
2. Access to a maintained high-performance computational server and, \
3. Training in bioinformatics. 



```{r fig-core, echo = F, eval = T }
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/flb202/Documents/GitHub/BRIC_Web/Core/Core3.png')
```

* Data analysis is offered to other scientists at the University of Copenhagen and external institutions, although with a priority to BRIC scientists.


# Our Services

Our support involves **consultation**, **data analysis**, **guidance**, **long-term projects** and **training**.

## **Consultation**

You are always welcome to talk with us! We can work together to understand your needs.

<span style="color:black"> **No fee is applied to understand your needs**</span>

## **Experimental Desing**

Including a bioinformatician in an early stage of your project can save you time, work, and money and make you apply effort and what matters.

## **Data Analysis**

When you have your data but need help running the pipeline or us to do everything, we can talk to understand your needs.

We're always open to talk.

## **Standard bioinformatics project**

**A plus in using our services:** We work with optimized pipelines ensuring reproducibility and providing reports.


<span style="color:black"> **Estimating hours is always challenging; we can offer a starter package of 20 to 30hrs for the following analysis**</span>

1. Gene Expression \
1.1 RNA-seq \
1.2 ...

2. Ataq-seq

3. Single Cell

**An Example of a Standard RNA-seq dataset analyses**

## **End-To-End**

We aim to be able to provide an End-to-End analysis for your project.
Currently, we're taking care of your data and analysis and working in collaboration with other facilities. Please, contact us for more information on how to get the best of us.

**Juliana Assis, PhD**

juliana.geraldo@bric.ku.dk \

I'm a Biologist with a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. My field lies broadly in multi-omics data such as Genomic, Transcriptomic, Metagenomic, Metabolomics, and Data Integration.
I have extensive experience developing the strategy/experimental design and scientific skills for NGS analysis and long-reads. Making Reproducibility in research is my main focus of study. 
*My home country is Brazil, and I'm very proud of my cooking skills.*


**Linbu Liao, Ph.D.**

```{r fig-lin, echo = F, eval = T }
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/flb202/Documents/GitHub/BRIC_Web/Core/Linbu.png')
```

linbu.liao@bric.ku.dk \

I hold a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and am a Bioinformatician. As a member of the CellX project, I am tasked with developing Spatial Transcriptomics tools to better comprehend how cells communicate with one another. My relevant work is [SC2Spa, a deep learning-based tool to map transcriptome to spatial origins at cellular resolution](https://sc2spa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

*I'm Chinese. In China, I received a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering as well as a master's degree in software engineering. I made substantial adjustments in both disciplines and locations. Staying on the righteous path is more important to me than being who I am supposed to be.*
